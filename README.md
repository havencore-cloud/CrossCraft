# CrossCraft
An open source compiler for universal Minecraft modding.

CrossCraft helps Minecraft modders create mods that can work across both Java and Bedrock editions using a shared, high-level mod definition format (like YAML or DSL). The goal is to make modding easier, more accessible, and fair, while respecting platform rules and player safety.

## What CrossCraft Does
- Provides a universal mod definition format for creating blocks, items, recipes, entities, and more.
- Generates Java code compatible with Forge/Fabric for Java Edition.
- Generates Bedrock Add-On JSON and official script files (where possible).
- Flags features that cannot map safely or legally between editions.

## What CrossCraft Does Not Do
- Does not generate or support code designed for exploits, cheats, or unfair gameplay.
- Does not inject code into Bedrockâ€™s engine or tamper with protected internals.
- Does not reverse-engineer or violate Mojang/Microsoft terms of service.

## License
CrossCraft is licensed under the MIT License. It is free and open source, and we ask contributors to help keep it ethical and aligned with the spirit of Minecraft.
